# Investigating Netflix Movies 

**Key Learnings**

- Imported Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
- Loaded the Netflix dataset and subsetted for just movies 
- Filtered for specific columns like title, release year, duration etc. 
- Filtered movies based on duration to find short movies
- Used iterrows to apply conditional logic and color coding by genre
- Created a scatter plot showing movie duration vs release year
- Added plot styling and axis labels

**Analysis**

The scatter plot visualizes the trend of movie durations over release years. Children's movies seem to have consistent short durations across years. Comedies and dramas vary more in length. We see an overall downward trend but there are exceptions, so more analysis would be needed to make definitive claims about movies getting shorter over time.

This project provided good practice with Pandas ops like filtering, subsetting df, iterrows and visualizing data with Matplotlib. More analysis can be done around genres, production countries etc.
